        </p>

        <h2>Why AI Girlfriends Are Popular in India</h2>
        <h3>1. Cultural Acceptance of Technology</h3>
        <p>
          India has always been quick to adopt new technology. With over 750 million internet users, Indians are increasingly comfortable 
          with <strong>digital relationships</strong> and virtual companionship. AI girlfriend apps provide a safe space for emotional connection.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Breaking Traditional Dating Barriers</h3>
        <p>
          Traditional Indian dating comes with family pressures, societal expectations, and cultural constraints. <strong>AI girlfriends</strong> 
          offer freedom from these barriers, allowing young Indians to explore relationships without judgment.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Urban Loneliness Epidemic</h3>
