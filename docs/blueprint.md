## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #64B5F6 (RGB) – A soft blue that is reminiscent of the calming and reliable nature of WhatsApp, but with a slightly modern and vibrant twist.
- Background color: #F0F7FF (RGB) – Very light, desaturated blue provides a clean and airy feel.
- Accent color: #7986CB (RGB) – A slightly more saturated analogous color adds depth and visual interest to interactive elements, such as buttons and notifications.
- Clean, readable font, similar to the standard system fonts for web, to maintain a familiar and accessible interface. Ensure the font is optimized for various screen sizes to enhance readability across devices.
- Use recognizable icons that mirror those found in WhatsApp for features like sending messages, attaching files, and displaying status. Simple, outlined icons will maintain a modern aesthetic.
- Adopt a layout that closely resembles WhatsApp Web, including the placement of the chat window, contact list, and settings. The interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance user experience. Examples include a smooth transition for new messages, a loading animation for typing, and a gentle fade-in effect for profile updates.
